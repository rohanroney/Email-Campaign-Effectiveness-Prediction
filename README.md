# Email Campaign Effectiveness Prediction
These project is part of the “Machine Learning &Advanced Machine Learning” curriculum as capstone projects at [AlmaBetter](https://www.almabetter.com/). 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective<br>
The main objective is to create a machine learning model to characterize the mail and track the mail that is ignored; read; acknowledged by the reader. 
Most of the small to medium business owners are making effective use of Gmail-based Email marketing Strategies for offline targeting of converting their
prospective customers into leads so that they stay with them in Business.



### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost


## Project Description
* EDA - Performed exploratory data analysis on numerical and categorical data.
* Data Cleaning - Missing value imputation,Outlier Treaatment
* Imabalance handling - First tried Under sampling and implemented baseline models then due to loss of information moved to different technique i.e oversampling using SMOTE and got better results.
* Feature Selection - Used information gain for feature selection and dropped features which had less information gain
* Model development - Tried different model and finally compared all models F1 and roc_auc score.


## Needs of this project
